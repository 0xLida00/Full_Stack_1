        <h1>Toofan From Togo<br></h1>
        <h3>About WL</h3>
        <p>Toofan was initially a Togolese music trio formed by Fatowou Kossivi Sourou Juste (alias Master Just), Blaise Mensah Ayaho (alias Barabas), and Akue Goeh Adote (alias All One). The music group which originally was a rap group gained fame in Togo with their debut album "Ogbragada 2006", which included a song that encouraged the national football team of Togo, Les Eperviers. Toofan continued as a duo after member All One decided to pursue his academic career. They recorded two more albums, "Confirmation" and "Carte de visite", and started to perform abroad in countries such as France, Côte d'Ivoire, and the United States. They became increasingly successful outside of Togo, and they went on tours across West Africa, Chad, and Gabon. Toofan released their albums "Overdose" in 2014 and "Conquistadors" in 2018.</p>
